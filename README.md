## 🎯 Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project was to enhance vanilla JavaScript skills by building a complex application without relying on heavy frameworks like React or Vue initially. Key learning areas included:
- **DOM Manipulation & Event Listeners:** Creating a dynamic user interface that responds to user actions instantly.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Structuring code using Classes to manage entities like `Product`, `Cart`.
- **ES6 Modules:** Breaking the codebase into maintainable, reusable files.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Handling backend communication using `fetch`, `async`, and `await`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend Integration:** interacting with a remote backend to retive the products and adding simple cart functionality
## ✨ Key Features
- **Dynamic Product Rendering:** Products are loaded dynamically from a data source.
- **Shopping Cart System:**
  - Add to cart functionality.
  - Update quantities.
  - Real-time total price calculation.
  - Persisting cart data (e.g., LocalStorage).
- **Search & Filter:** Users can search for specific items or filter by category.
- **Checkout Flow:** A simulated checkout process.
